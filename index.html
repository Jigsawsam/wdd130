                <p> Hello! My name is Bitner I am currently learning Web development and it has been fun making this Website. I enjoy drawing, playing pool, and videogames, as well as hiking and running. Recently, I have also been learning to design 3D models, which has been a fun and challenging new hobby for me. I was called to serve in a mission at New Mexico Albuquerque and I enjoyed it a lot! I am grateful for the many skills I gained in the mission that I still use today such as speaking better Spanish. I grew up in Washington state and recently moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. I have a kitten named Wolfina who was rescued from the cold snow of Washington and she is a sweet kitty.</p>
